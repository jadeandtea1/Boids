# Boids
Influenced by Sebastian Lague and Coding Train

Simple 2D Boid simulation in Unity 2020.3.28f1

Issues:
  - Boids across the screen cannot see each other -> boids end up crowding against the walls
  - Direction of boid not displayed

IMPORTANT FOR DOWNLOAD:
  - Library folder for Unity is not included because it is too big
